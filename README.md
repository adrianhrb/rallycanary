_- Miguel √Ångel Su√°rez - Eduardo Gonz√°lez, champions of the canary asphalt rally championship in the season 2023_

The objetive is build a website where people can see information about Rallyes in the Canary Islands. The project will be developed with Django to continue learning this tool that I'm using in my studies

## Starting üöÄ

_This section will help you to have a copy of the project in your local computer in case you want to work, change or test something_

The project is still **under development**, so there will be **no documentation on the deployment** of the project yet.

### Installation and requirements üîß

_You can check requirements of the project on the [requirements.txt file](requirements.txt)_

Because the project will be done with Django-Python, we will need a Python Virtual Enviroment to install all dependencies. You can run in a terminal the following commands:

```console
$ python -m venv .venv --prompt mysite
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If something goes wrong make sure you have Python installed or or else try to launch the command indicating the version of Python:

```console
$ python3.X -m venv .venv --prompt mysite
```

> [!TIP]
> In case of doubts you can see [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Some functionalities will involve the use of sensitive information, so we will use a `.env` file for this purpose. This file must be out of version control so you will need to create one. In the project (mostly in the settings.py file) there will be calls to a config function of the prettyconf library, all these calls are the information that the `.env` file must contain.

### Database üíæ

The database that will be used in the project is PostgreSQL. This will help us to apply vectorial searches to allow user to search by various fields.

The current design is:
